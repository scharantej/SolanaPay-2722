## Flask Application Design for a Payments Platform Using Solana Blockchain

### HTML Files

The following HTML files are essential for the Flask application:

- **index.html**: The main page of the application, responsible for user interaction and form submission.

- **success.html**: A confirmation page displayed after a successful payment is made.

- **error.html**: An error page displayed if a payment encounters any issues.

### Routes

The necessary routes for the application are:

- **@app.route('/')**: The home route, displaying the payment form in `index.html`.

- **@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])**: The payment submission route, which processes the payment form data and initiates the Solana transaction.

- **@app.route('/success')**: The success route, displayed after a successful payment.

- **@app.route('/error')**: The error route, displayed if the payment encounters an issue.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should implement the Solana transaction logic using appropriate libraries and follow the Solana blockchain best practices.

- For improved user experience, consider incorporating a payment status update mechanism, such as a loading screen or periodic notifications.

- Ensure that the application adheres to security measures, including input validation and CSRF protection.
